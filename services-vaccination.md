text: "Our dedicated staff and veterinarians know that each type of pet requires specific vaccines to prevent illness. Like humans, pets are susceptible to potentially dangerous and contagious diseases. We provide the latest preventative medicine so that your pet has the best possible chance of recovery. We vaccinate against rabies, distemper, leptospirosis and feline CPR. We also keep a record of all vaccination dates as well as reminders for upcoming vaccinations. We provide certificates to all our pet parents as part of official record keeping."

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>PetZone is made up of a group of highly equipped veterinary clinics which were started by Dr. Leena Dala [M. V. Sc. (Surgery)]. In 2001. Dr. Dalal first started out in Churchgate, Mumbai, with a veterinary clinic that came fully equipped with all round pet care services. Thanks to the successfulness of PetZone Churchgate, Dr. Dalal teamed up with Dr. Deep Vasudeo, our in house physiotherapist, and started a new venture in Mahalaxmi in 2011. PetZone Mahalaxmi comes fully equipped with a swimming pool for your pets as well as a highly skilled veterinary team. Now, PetZone has started a new clinic in Goa! This could only be done due to the huge success and hard work of all the dedicated staff members at all PetZones in Mumbai. PetZone Goa is a one stop shop for all our patients and their parents. We are equipped with all round services such as x-ray machine, cardiac consultations, physiotherapy consultations, grooming facilities, pet shop, surgical facilities, and most importantly medical diagnostics and treatment. PetZones all over provide the same great care and results every parent wishes to receive for their pets. From all the staff at PetZone we welcome you to our family and hope you are pleased with our service.</p>

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>PetZone is made up of a group of highly equipped veterinary clinics which were started by Dr. Leena Dalal.  In 2001. Dr. Dalal first started out in Churchgate, Mumbai, with a veterinary clinic that was fully equipped with all round pet care services. Thanks to the success of PetZone Churchgate, Dr. Dalal teamed up with Dr. Deep Vasudeo, our in house physiotherapist, and started a new venture in Mahalaxmi in 2011. PetZone Mahalaxmi is fully equipped with a swimming pool for your pets, as well as a highly skilled veterinary team. Now, PetZone has  a new clinic in Goa! This could only be done due to the huge success and hard work of all the dedicated staff members at both PetZones in Mumbai. PetZone Goa is also a one stop shop for all our patients and their parents. All PetZone clinics offer full services,  such as an x-ray, cardiac consultations, physiotherapy consultations, grooming facilities, pet supplies, surgical facilities, and most importantly medical and surgical diagnostics and treatment. PetZones all over provide the same great care and results that every parent wishes to receive for their pets. From all the staff at PetZone we welcome you to our family and hope you are pleased with our service.</p>

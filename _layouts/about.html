      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>PetZone is made up of a group of highly equipped veterinary clinics which were started by Dr. Leena Dalal. In 2001. Dr. Dalal first started out in Churchgate, Mumbai, with a veterinary clinic that was fully equipped with all round pet care services. Thanks to the success of PetZone Churchgate, Dr. Dalal teamed up with Dr. Deep Vasudeo, our in house physiotherapist, and started a new venture in Mahalaxmi in 2011. PetZone Mahalaxmi is fully equipped as well with a highly skilled veterinary team. PetZone opened in Goa in 2015 and in Powai in 2020. In 2019, Petzone Surgery, the dedicated surgical wing of Petzone was inaugurated. Petzone surgery is a state of the art superspecialty surgical unit offering Orthopedic, Interventional as well as other specialty surgery options. This could only be done due to the huge success and hard work of all the dedicated staff members at all PetZones. All PetZone clinics offer full services, such as an x-ray, cardiac consultations, physiotherapy consultations, grooming facilities, pet supplies, surgical facilities, and most importantly medical and surgical diagnostics and treatment. PetZones all over provide the same great care and results that every parent wishes to receive for their pets.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>PetZone is made up of a group of highly equipped veterinary clinics which were started by Dr. Leena Dalal. In 2001. Dr. Dalal first started out in Churchgate, Mumbai, with a veterinary clinic that was fully equipped with all round pet care services. Thanks to the success of PetZone Churchgate, Dr. Dalal teamed up with Dr. Deep Vasudeo, our in house physiotherapist, and started a new venture in Mahalaxmi in 2011. PetZone Mahalaxmi is fully equipped as well with a highly skilled veterinary team. PetZone opened in Goa in 2015 and in Powai in 2020. In 2019, Petzone Surgery, the dedicated surgical wing of Petzone was inaugurated. Petzone surgery is a state of the art superspecialty surgical unit offering Orthopedic, Interventional as well as other specialty surgery options. This could only be done due to the huge success and hard work of all the dedicated staff members at all PetZones. All PetZone clinics offer full services, such as an x-ray, cardiac consultations, physiotherapy consultations, grooming facilities, pet supplies, surgical facilities, and most importantly medical and surgical diagnostics and treatment. PetZones all over provide the same great care and results that every parent wishes to receive for their pets.

Fortunately the only major injury he suffered despite the fall from this height was a split in his palate, but he required surgery immediately so that he could eat without the fear of food and water going into his lungs. Our veterinarians and surgeon were able to stitch Prince's palate back up within 20 minutes! He has completely recovered since the surgery, and is eating and drinking water as normal. He also provided his owners with lots of entertainment when he woke up from his anaesthesia and ran all over the house like nothing happened!</p>

            <p>Michiko first came to us when she had trouble walking. She would slip to one side and couldn't balance her own weight. This was because she had loss of muscle mass and a neurological deficit in her hind legs. Michiko was treated with physiotherapy at PetZone Mahalaxmi and within 6 weeks she was showing improvement. She would try and jump onto couches at home, and run and trot away without falling or slipping. The physiotherapy strengthened her musculature and stimulated her nerves, which helped her get back to her usual happy and playful self! She was even able to swim after her last physiotherapy session without any difficulty and has been very active ever since! You can see her walking before and after her physiotherapy sessions in the video below. PetZone can provide your pets the same kind of treatment which can help them get back to their happy selves!</p>

text: "Pet patients today have a distinct advantage over their predecessors of a few decades ago. Back then, only a few rudimentary tests were available to veterinarians. Blood tests are integral in determining the health status of your pet. Blood tests can give our veterinarians a wealth of information about pet’s general health and about the efficiency of his/her internal organs. Abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the blood serum can indicate a disease even before the symptoms appear. Blood tests can make the difference between knowing if a pet’s kidneys are failing or they are just dehydrated. We can determine if your pet’s blood clotting ability and ability of the immune system to respond and if he/she is anaemic. We also carry out routine blood tests before any surgery, including spays or neuters, so we can ensure that your pet is healthy enough to undergo the anaesthesia and the procedure."

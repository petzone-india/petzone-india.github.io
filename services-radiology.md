text: "The process of taking an x-ray is least invasive and pain free and helps our veterinarians better understand what is happening inside your petâ€™s body. The process may take 10-15 minutes after which we are immediately interpret the images of the x-rays. X-rays can help identify broken bone, diseases, cancers and infections. X-rays also help veterinarians formulate a medical and/or surgical treatment plan for your pet in a short amount of time. At PetZone we email the x-ray images to owners so they are easily accessible at any time. This is specifically beneficial for specialist consultations such as <a href="services-cardiac" title="Cardiac Link">cardiac</a> or <a href="services-physio" title="Physio Link">physiotherapy</a> consults. We are constantly in touch with all veterinarians at every clinic location. We can therefore ask for a cardiac consult from our in house cardiologist at PetZone Churchgate while your pet is being treated at PetZone Mahalaxmi or PetZone Goa."

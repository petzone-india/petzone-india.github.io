title: "Physiotherapy & Hydrotherapy"
text: "Like human physiotherapy, animal physiotherapy uses techniques to increase function and mobility of joints and muscles. It has been proven to maximise the overall physical recovery our patients. Hydrotherapy and physiotherapy can be useful in lots of different situations. These can include rehabilitating orthopaedic patients after surgery, managing chronic osteoarthritis and managing orthopaedic or neurological conditions without surgery. Physiotherapy offers many benefits to pets which include reduced pain, increased function and mobility of joints, enhanced and earlier recovery from surgery and injury. Hydrotherapy is a type of physiotherapy that takes place in water. The natural buoyancy of the water takes strain off the joints and gives animals confidence to move their limbs in a full range of motion. Hydrotherapy offers many benefits such as reduced strain on joints, reduced pain, swelling and stiffness, improved range of movement of joint, improved circulation, improved cardiovascular fitness, improved tissue healing, increased speed of recovery and weight loss. Our in house physiotherapist at PetZone Mahalaxmi can provide your pets with this kind of care and treatment as and when required."
